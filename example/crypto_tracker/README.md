# Nano Example

This directory contains a complete example application demonstrating the capabilities of the Nano state management library.

## Features Demonstrated

*   **Atomic State**: Using `Atom<T>` for reactive state management.
*   **Business Logic**: Implementing `NanoLogic` to separate UI and logic.
*   **Dependency Injection**: Using `Scope` and `Registry` for modularity.
*   **Async State**: Handling API calls with `AsyncAtom` and automatic loading/error states.
*   **Routing**: Managing navigation state.
*   **Theming**: Dynamic theme switching.

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
